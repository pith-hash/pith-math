//! Complex and real discrete Fourier transforms over `f64`.
//!
//! The forward transform uses the unnormalized physics convention
//! `X[k] = Σ_j x[j]·e^(−2πi·j·k/N)` and the inverse undoes it exactly:
//! [`ifft`]`(`[`fft`]`(x)) = x` element-wise within a few ulps. All sizes
//! are powers of two; the kernel is the iterative radix-2 Cooley–Tukey
//! butterfly, in place, O(N log N) time, O(1) extra space.
//!
//! [`fft_real`] is the convenience wrapper the kit actually calls (audio
//! peak picking in `pith-audio`): it packs the real input into a
//! complex buffer and runs the same kernel rather than the faster
//! real-input packing trick. The wasted factor of two is deliberate — the
//! pack/unpack split-radix path doubles the code for a saving that only
//! matters on inputs far larger than the kit's 4096-sample windows, and a
//! single butterfly is the path every test exercises.
